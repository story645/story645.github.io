<p> A central question in supporting catagorical data is which libraries and how? 
Matplotlib wants to avoid conditional supports because they are messy and can lead to unreasonable quote bloat quite quickly. 
And it puts the onus on matplotlib to maintain that the conversions work throughout api changes in the client side library (such as pandas or xray). 
Instead, in discussion with a pandas developer, the plan is to write the conversion code such that it lives in the library providing the data (such as pandas) 
and that code is registered with matplotlib.</p>

<p>Because the quite amazing <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> already supports a lot of plots of it's catagorical data, 
it makes for the perfect library to test out this plan. If this works, it will also hopefully yield a guide to adding support for your favorite 
library. </p>

<p>This past week, instead of diving straight into the matplotlib code base, I've been reading issues. A lot of issues, 200 and counting. 
It's kinda therapeutic, but more importantly has given me a crash course of sorts on how the matplotlib community operates. 
I'm starting to see how issues get reported, and resolved, and why they get stalled and I get to feel the joy of finding the stray issue that's been resolved.
I've even found a couple of issues that I could probably tackle. </p>

<p>So if you want to get involved in a project and are finding that their issue/PR tracker is at least a bit overwhelming, 
I urge you to get out your metaphorical duster and join in on some housekeeping. </p>

<p>It's fairly typical for matplotlib users to need to plot catagorical data:
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/oVMKFEO.png" alt="picture"></p>

<p>And even a graph this simple requires the user to unpack a native data structure in order to create it:</p>

<pre><code>data = {'apples':10, 'oranges':15, 'lemons':5, 'limes':20}
fig = plt.figure()`
ax = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)`
ax.bar(range(4), data.values(), tick_label=data.keys(), 
       align='center', color='lightgray')
ax.xaxis.set_tick_params(size=0)
</code></pre>

<p>One of the major aims of this project is to simplify the process so that at the least, the ax.bar call can be reduced to something like <code>ax.bar(data.keys(), data.values(), align='center', color='lightgray')</code></p>

<p>This project aims to encompass more than just bar graphs, and more than just dictionaries; support charts and data structures will determined as the project develops. </p>
