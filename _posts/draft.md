I wanna start with a shout out to Numpy core developer Jaime Fernández del Río for essentially 
drafting a [starter guide to Numpy C development](https://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2016-July/075843.html) in 
response to my asking the mailing list for help getting oriented. So now I'm kinda venturing down a side rabbit hole of 
Python C & Numpy C dev, but at least it's well guided. I also have much appreciation for my mentor @tacaswell for voicing 
confidence in my skills, 'specially as a few days back I was treated to some condescension towards my Pandas skills 
(note: this is another library I teach fairly often, but even if I was a newbie to Pandas,it would still be not okay). As 
I get deeper into the weeds in the Python, Numpy, & Matplotlib community, I honestly 
get more amazed at how generally kind and friendly the community generally is. It's, possibly sadly, just a little bit 
surprising 'cause I'm used to hostility
