A central question in supporting catagorical data is which libraries and how? 

Matplotlib wants to avoid conditional supports because they are messy and can lead to unreasonable quote bloat quite quickly. 
And it puts the onus on matplotlib to maintain that the conversions work throughout api changes in the client side library (such as pandas or xray). 
Instead, in discussion with a pandas developer, the plan is to write the conversion code such that it lives in the library providing the data (such as pandas) 
and that code is registered with matplotlib.

Because the quite amazing <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> already supports a lot of plots of its catagorical data, 
it makes for the perfect library to test out this plan. If this works, it will also hopefully yield a guide to adding support for your favorite 
library.

So where am I  starting? 

I'm reading the following lovely pieces of code as a framework:
 
 * Date convertors: [pandas](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/tseries/converter.py), [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/dates.py)
 
 * Registration model & unit conversion: [units](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/units.py), 
 [tests](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/tests/test_units.py),
 [jpl units](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/tree/master/lib/matplotlib/testing/jpl_units)
 
And I'm documenting my task list on the wiki 
for [my fork of matplotlib](https://github.com/story645/matplotlib/wiki/gsoc) so that I can find it and my mentors and I can stay
on the same page. Going by our weekly meetings, my todo says:

1) Write tests modeled on the matplotlib [ticker tests](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/tests/test_ticker.py#L215)

2) Get [tickers, formatters, and locators](http://matplotlib.org/api/ticker_api.html) working natively with 
pandas [catagorical dataframe](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/categorical.html)

3) bundle it up in a matplotlib pull request

4) after mpl dev discussion, pitch it to pandas as a PR
