Let's talk workflow 'cause I've spent a rather insane amount of time fighting with git. And while I much prefer mercurial, I've been using git for a few years now and so it's not like I'm new to it. But, let me tell you about the many ways in which git and I are not friends right now. While I've been using version control back to when SVN was a thing, I've never really used version control in a large project, multiple branches & developers setting. And my go to is commit small and often...so my commit branch tends to be super muddled...

So rebase, right? Uh...yeah...it's confusing as all out and I had to try it a zillion times before I found 
[a tutorial that was clear to me](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html)
and grokked the ever so unintuitive "PICK THE OLDEST COMMIT" and squash everything else. I still haven't found anything that 
clearly explains how to fix merge conflicts, which wasn't an issue in matplotlib but in a way old open PR on nltk. It took me multiple branches and resets and rebases before I got a somewhat clean pull request that was up to date with develop. I should totally rebase to clean up the commit stream, but that's a rabbit hole I'm avoiding unless the nltk devs request it. 

But, at least for future MPL issues, one of my mentors helpfully pointed me to the [dev workflow page](http://matplotlib.org/devel/gitwash/development_workflow.html), so that's 
bookmarked for future reference. And this all came up because my mentors wanted to get my PR merged into master; said messy rebase later, basic string/categorical axis support is now merged into master. Next up is folding in support for Python3 dicts by creating a wrapper that in theory can be used to fold in support for other non convertable to array types.

And I think I have to learn [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/index.html) as matplotlib is moving from nose (now deprecated) to pytest for testing. I have :no_mouth: emotions about this 'cause I feel like the pytest docs suffer from the same issues as the nose docs, namely that they can be incredibly confusing for people who aren't knee deep in testing. I prefer unittests mostly 'cause those docs are better at assuming that the user doesn't know anything about testing. But yeah, that's a next task and a rabbit hole I shouldn't wonder too far down.

Also, I wish I could've gone to PyCon, but alas, instead I've got 3 high school students in my lab learning how to use Python to try to sort out how accurately satellites measure snow.
