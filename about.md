I'm a graduate student in computer science at The Graduate Center, CUNY. I've been using Python for close to a decade now, and have been teaching Python for about 6 years. I've taught the scientific Python stack to high school students, undergrads, graduate students, & professors-and I've even taught the matplotlib tutorial at PyCon. 

I'm participating in GSOC 2016 'cause I saw that matplotlib was on the list and desperately wanted to get involved because I've been wanting to get involved on the other side. This is the chronical of my journey from user to contributor.
